## How do we store, share and disclose your information?
The primary storage of your information resides within a cache, ensuring temporary hold and it is not generally disclosed to any third parties, with the notable exceptions of Discord and OpenAI, as this is integral to our operation. Essential information, such as your server ID, is securely stored on our servers in order to effectively deliver our services and to retain your chosen settings. Upon your consent, we may store additional data on our servers, such as ratings submissions.

For audio data, we implement a stringent policy of maintaining this information solely within a temporary cache. In addition, data indicating who is speaking for voice channel transcription purposes is also included. This information is exclusively shared with OpenAI to facilitate the delivery of our services.

We may disseminate aggregated analytical data for the purpose of demonstrating usage trends; however, this data is carefully compiled to ensure that no personally identifiable information is included.

Apart from necessary data sharing with Discord and OpenAI to ensure Brew(r)'s functionality, we strictly limit any disclosure or sharing of stored information with third parties, adhering diligently to our commitment to user privacy.

## How is information deleted?
Information stored on our servers will automatically be deleted if you remove Brew(r) from your server(s).

In some cases, some information is only stored in cache and will be deleted when Brew(r) is restarted for any reason or by time.

## Updating this policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. We will notify users through our [Discord server](https://asrp.dev/discord/) and Brew(r) when we make any changes to this policy.
