### Service Limitations & Modifications
We use our best efforts to provide the best service possible. However, we make no guarantees that the bot will be available at all times. We may also limit the bot's availability to you or your server(s) at any time for any reason.

For example, the bot's abilities may be limited if:

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the bot or any service to which it connects, with or without notice and without liability to you.
