### Service Limitations & Modifications
We use our best efforts to provide the best service possible. However, we make no guarantees that the bot will be available at all times. We may also limit the bot's availability to you or your server(s) at any time for any reason.

For example, the bot's abilities may be limited if:
- The bot/server is under maintenance
- The bot/server is experiencing technical difficulties
- The bot/server is experiencing high load
- The bot/server is affected by bugs or errors

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the bot or any service to which it connects, with or without notice and without liability to you.

## User Content
When using the bot, you will be allowed to provide input through text prompts, uploading attachment(s)/file(s), or connecting the bot to a voice channel (VC) to utilize its services. In addition, you may use your server's pre-existing roles, categories, and channels to provide context to the bot. You are responsible for the content of the input you provide to the bot, whether it's in the form of a text prompt or an attachment/file.

You agree to not provide any inputs/outputs that violate:
- OpenAI's Usage Policies
- Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines
- Any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to those governing intellectual property, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, or false advertising)
- The privacy of other users

We reserve the right to reject your input/output if it is deemed inappropriate in accordance with OpenAI's Usage Policies.

## Paid Services
Should you choose to purchase a paid service from us, you agree to pay the fees associated with the service. You also agree to abide by the terms outlined in this document and any additional terms that may be provided to you at the time of purchase.

Failure to pay the fees associated with the service or abide by the terms outlined in this document and any additional terms that may be provided to you at the time of purchase may result in the limitation or termination of your access to the service.

## Termination
We reserve the right to terminate your access to the bot, without cause or notice, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with you. All provisions of these Terms of Service that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

Examples of reasons for termination include, but are not limited to:
- Abusive behavior towards the bot or its related systems or networks
- Violating the acceptable use outlined in this document, such as, but not limited to, providing inappropriate content to the bot

## Governing Law
These Terms of Service shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

EXCEPT AS REPRESENTED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE BOT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS".

IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS, UNLESS SUCH DAMAGES ARISE FROM GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT ON OUR PART. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID US IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS.
